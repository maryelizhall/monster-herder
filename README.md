# monster-herder
Herding game in python

Welcome to Monster Herder!  Here are some directions:
- Your goal is to move the robot to herd the monsters through the door in the bottom left corner.
- Collect coins along the way for extra points!
- Each monster that goes through the gate is worth 3 points.
- Each coin collected is worth 1 point.
- Each monster that escapes through the right or left side of the window is a 1 point deduction.
- The monsters will scatter if you don't try to herd them.
- They'll move closer together and away from them when the robot is in motion.

Have fun!
