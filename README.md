# monster-herder

Welcome to Monster Herder!  Here are some directions:
- Your goal is to move the dog to herd the sheep through the fence in the bottom left corner.
- Collect coins along the way for extra points!
- Each sheep that goes through the gate is worth 3 points.
- Each coin collected is worth 1 point.
- Each sheep that escapes through the right or left side of the window is a 1 point deduction.
- The sheep will scatter if you don't try to herd them.
- They'll move closer together and away from the dog when the dog is in motion.

Have fun!
